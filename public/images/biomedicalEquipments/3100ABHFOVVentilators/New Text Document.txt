3100A/B HFOV Ventilators

The 3100 series High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilators (HFOV) are proven for intervening in treating respiratory 
failure in neonates and ARDS in pediatric and adult patients. Using lung protective tools, you can apply 
continuous distending pressure and superimpose minimal pressure and volume swings to inflate 
the lung, and avoid respiratory failure. 
As shown in numerous clinical and peer-reviewed studies, the 3100 series ventilators help enhance 
patient care for critically injured patients.
