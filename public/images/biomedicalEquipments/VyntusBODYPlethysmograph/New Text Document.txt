Vyntus™ BODY Plethysmograph

People come in all shapes and sizes, so we designed Vyntus™ BODY to accommodate most patients without increasing the cabin footprint. Many enhancements were incorporated to make Vyntus™ BODY accessible and user-friendly for both patients and technicians.

Vyntus™ BODY employs much of the same breakthrough technology found in the Vyntus™ ONE, but with a redesigned breathing circuit and our new Ultrasonic Sensor Technology.  In addition, Vyntus™ BODY is enhanced with additional innovation such as digital pressure compensation, which helps to reduce environmental influences and improves measurement accuracy.
