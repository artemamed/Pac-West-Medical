Infant Flow™ SiPAP

For over two decades, the Infant Flow™ nCPAP system has delivered gentle respiratory support to thousands of neonates worldwide. The system, combined with the patented variable flow generator, provides NPPV by offering nasal CPAP and Biphasic modalities. The system takes the work out of breathing, freeing precious calories to be used for growth and development.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome each recommend the early use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
